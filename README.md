# Trashlib
Trashlib is a library mod that I (trashoflevillage) add code that I commonly need in my mods to. That way, I don't have to rewrite the same methods over and over, and can also try to make updating my mods an easier process.

If you'd like to use Trashlib to help with the development of your own mod, you might want to check out the [setup page](https://github.com/trashoflevillage/trashlib/blob/master/wiki/setup.md).
